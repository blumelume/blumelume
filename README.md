### Hi I'm Max!

I am especially interested in how I can use my skill set to make a useful impact. On our society and our future.

I have been passionate about Computer Science for years. Since then, I have created websites, worked with the newest technologies such as WebAR, and developed solutions to community problems.
I am also very involved in film. Both with my own projects, as well as as a Setrunner on bigger German television productions.

Currently, I work remotely for a freelancing Web-Dev and online strategist. 
In 2022 I am planning to start my Software Engineering degree.
